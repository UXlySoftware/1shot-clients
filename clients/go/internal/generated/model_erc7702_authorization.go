// A single authorization for an ERC-7702 transaction. It represents a single potential delegation from an EOA to a contract. The EOA must sign a message with the contract address, the chain ID, and a nonce. Authorizations are sticky, once a Contract Method has been executed with an authorization, future Contract Methods may be executed for the EOA using the authorized contract without a new authorization being submitted.
type Erc7702Authorization struct {
	Address string `json:"address"`
	// The delegation nonce. This starts at 0 and must be positive. The EOA must keep track of this nonce itself.
	Nonce string `json:"nonce"`
	ChainId *EChain `json:"chainId"`
	// The signature of the authorization, from the EOA that is delegating the authorization to the contract at address.
	Signature string `json:"signature"`
}
