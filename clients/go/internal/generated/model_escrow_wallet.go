// An Escrow Wallet is a custodial Hot Wallet controlled by 1Shot. It is a normal Externally Owned Account, and can be used like any normal wallet. 1Shot executes Transactions via an Escrow Wallet, which must at least hold some gas token for the chain. Escrow Wallets are linked to a particular chain for safety and ease of use; technically an EOA address can be used on any EVM chain but the potential for confusion is greater than the utility provided. You may define as many Escrow Wallets as you need. Each Transaction is configured with a default Escrow Wallet but this can be overridden. The Transaction will be submitted via that wallet and paid for from that wallet. Escrow Wallets owned by a Business are the only ones used by 1Shot, but wallets owned by an individual User may be supported in the future.
type EscrowWallet struct {
	Id string `json:"id"`
	AccountAddress string `json:"accountAddress"`
	BusinessId string `json:"businessId"`
	// The User ID of the person that owns this wallet. Admin escrow wallets will not have this value. An escrow wallet will have either a user ID or a business ID.
	UserId string `json:"userId"`
	ChainId *EChain `json:"chainId"`
	// The name of the escrow wallet.
	Name string `json:"name"`
	// Optional description of the escrow wallet, can be used to describe its purpose.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// Whether or not the escrow wallet is an admin escrow wallet, used for internal purposes.
